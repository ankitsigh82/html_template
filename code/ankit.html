        CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document. CSS describes how
        HTML elements should be displayed. This tutorial will teach you CSS from
        basic to advanced London is the capital city of England. It is the most
        populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13
        million inhabitants.The word cascading means that a style applied to a
        parent element will also apply to all children elements within the
        parent. So, if you set the color of the body text to "blue", all
        headings, paragraphs, and other text elements within the body will also
        get the same color (unless you specify something else)!</p>
